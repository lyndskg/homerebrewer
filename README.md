Automatic Troubleshooting for Homebrew Package Installations 

## Description:

homerebrewer automatically troubleshoots and debugs Homebrew package or library installation issues on your local machine.

The project will utilize system analysis, error detection algorithms, and user-friendly outputs to assist users in resolving installation problems with Homebrew packages.

Implemented and tested on a PC running macOS Ventura 14.3.1 w/ arm64 architecture. 


## Key Features:
1. Error Detection and Analysis: Implement algorithms to detect common installation errors and issues encountered while using Homebrew.
2. Troubleshooting Guidance: Provide users with step-by-step guidance on how to resolve specific installation errors and issues.
3. System Analysis: Conduct a comprehensive system analysis to identify any conflicting dependencies or system configurations that may cause installation problems.
4. Interactive Prompt: Develop an interactive prompt that guides users through the troubleshooting process and asks for additional inputs if needed.
5. User-Friendly Outputs: Display clear and user-friendly messages that explain the detected issues and the suggested solutions.
6. Arm64 Architecture Support: Ensure compatibility with macOS Ventura running on arm64 architecture.


## Best Coding Languages:
Python is an excellent choice for this project due to its ease of use, extensive libraries, and system analysis capabilities. Additionally, Bash scripting can be useful for interacting with Homebrew and the command-line environment.


## Basic Workflow:
1. User Input: Request the Homebrew package or library that the user wants to install and any specific options they are using.
2. Homebrew Analysis: Execute Homebrew commands to install the requested package, and capture the terminal output for analysis.
3. Error Detection: Implement algorithms to detect common installation errors and issues from the captured terminal output.
4. Troubleshooting: Based on the detected errors, provide step-by-step troubleshooting guidance to the user, offering solutions to resolve the issues.
5. Interactive Prompt (if needed): If additional information is required for troubleshooting, interactively prompt the user to provide more details.
6. User-Friendly Outputs: Display clear and concise messages that explain the detected issues and the suggested solutions.
7. Arm64 Architecture Compatibility: Ensure that the project is compatible with macOS Ventura running on arm64 architecture.

   
## Basic I/O Details:
The project should include a command-line interface (CLI) for user interaction. Users can run the homerebrewer program, enter the desired Homebrew package or library they wish to install, and observe the troubleshooting steps and solutions provided in the terminal.


homerebrewer aims to simplify the installation process of Homebrew packages, offering a valuable tool for developers to quickly resolve installation issues and streamline their software development workflow on macOS Ventura.
